description:
  Use when designing a CI/CD pipeline, adding a deployment stage, implementing
  rollback strategies, using feature flags, choosing between blue-green and
  canary deployments, coordinating database migrations with code deploys, or
  discussing progressive delivery. Also use when the user mentions Flagger, Argo
  Rollouts, OpenFeature, or error-budget-driven releases.

# Deployment

## Iron Law

`NO PRODUCTION DEPLOY WITHOUT A TESTED ROLLBACK PATH.`

If rollback exists only in theory, the deploy is not operationally designed.

## When to Use

- CI/CD pipelines, build/test/release stages, deploy strategies, rollback,
  feature flags, progressive delivery, supply-chain gates, or migration rollout
  coordination.

## When NOT to Use

- Local project bootstrap before deployment exists; use `scaffolding`.
- Database DDL/data safety itself; pair with `database`.
- Service monitoring and alert design; pair with `observability`.

## Core Ideas

1. Build once; promote the same immutable artifact.
2. Fast feedback gates belong early; expensive confidence gates belong before
   deploy.
3. Rollback must be faster and more reliable than emergency fix-forward.
4. Database migrations deploy before incompatible code and contract after old
   code is gone.
5. Progressive delivery gates on user-visible health, not just pod/process
   health.
6. Feature flags need owner, expiry, safe default, and cleanup.
7. CI/CD credentials, actions, images, and artifacts are supply-chain surfaces.

## Workflow

1. Define the artifact, environments, promotion path, and merge gate.
2. Put lint/type/test/security checks before merge where possible.
3. Design rollback and rehearse it for production systems.
4. Split migrations and feature flags into safe deploy phases.
5. Choose rolling, blue-green, canary, or manual approval based on blast radius.
6. Add deployment verification and alert thresholds before rollout.

## Verification

- [ ] One artifact is built and promoted; production does not rebuild from
      source.
- [ ] Merge gates run the repo's canonical lint, typecheck, test, and security
      checks.
- [ ] Rollback path is documented and recently rehearsed for production systems.
- [ ] Migration rollout is split into expand/backfill/switch/contract where
      needed.
- [ ] Progressive delivery gates on error rate and latency, not only readiness.
- [ ] Feature flags have owner, expiry, cleanup issue, and safe
      default-on-failure.
- [ ] CI credentials use least privilege; third-party actions/images are pinned.
- [ ] Release notes or PR body name deploy risk and rollback.

## Risk Tier

For prototypes or non-production systems, keep the same shape but record which
production checks are intentionally deferred and what must happen before first
real users.

## Handoffs

- Use `database` for migration mechanics and lock/backfill risk.
- Use `observability` for rollout metrics, dashboards, alerts, and runbooks.
- Use `security` for CI credentials, artifact signing, SBOMs, and dependency
  trust.
- Use `versioning` for the version bump, CHANGELOG entry, and tag that
  precedes a release rollout — deployment owns what happens after the tag.
