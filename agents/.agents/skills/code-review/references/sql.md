# SQL review reference

Use when reviewing SQL queries embedded in application code, or new
ad-hoc query scripts, in the diff. Apply this alongside the main
`code-review` skill workflow.

## When to defer

- **Schema, migrations, indexes added via DDL**: defer to the
  `database` skill — it owns production data risk, locking, and
  rollout.
- **ORM-generated queries**: review the call site (N+1, eager
  loading) using the language reference (e.g. `ruby.md` for AR,
  `dotnet.md` for EF Core, `python.md` for SQLAlchemy).
- This file focuses on **hand-written SQL in app code**, raw queries,
  views, and stored procedures.

## High-signal review checks

- **Parameterised queries**: every value derived from user input
  must use bind parameters, not string concatenation. String-built
  SQL is a Critical security finding regardless of how "trusted" the
  input looks.
- **No `SELECT *` in app code**: explicit column lists keep the wire
  contract stable when the schema grows. `SELECT *` is fine in
  ad-hoc queries and tests.
- **Indexes covering predicates**: `WHERE` columns, `JOIN` keys, and
  `ORDER BY` columns should be indexed (or the planner should pick a
  reasonable scan). Ask for the `EXPLAIN` plan when the query is on
  a hot path.
- **Set-based, not row-by-row**: a loop in the application that
  fires one query per row is almost always wrong. Push the work into
  a single `INSERT ... SELECT`, `UPDATE ... FROM`, or `MERGE`.
- **Deterministic ordering for pagination**: `ORDER BY created_at`
  alone is not stable across rows with the same timestamp. Add a
  tiebreaker (`ORDER BY created_at, id`) or use keyset pagination.
- **`OFFSET` for deep pagination**: scans + skips. Past the first
  few pages, switch to keyset (cursor) pagination.
- **`NULL` semantics**: `col = NULL` never matches; use `IS NULL` /
  `IS NOT NULL`. Aggregates ignore `NULL` (`COUNT(col)` ≠
  `COUNT(*)`); be explicit.
- **`JOIN` types**: an unintended `LEFT JOIN` matched against a
  non-null column in `WHERE` silently becomes an `INNER JOIN`. Spot
  filters on the right side of a left join.
- **Transaction scope**: keep transactions short. Long transactions
  hold locks and bloat MVCC. `BEGIN ... call_external_api ... COMMIT`
  is a finding — pull the side effect outside.
- **Lock escalation / hot rows**: `UPDATE` on a heavily-contended
  row, `SELECT FOR UPDATE` without a clear ordering, can deadlock.
  Note any new locking pattern.
- **Aggregations**: `GROUP BY` columns must include every non-aggregated
  column in the `SELECT`. Some dialects allow it implicitly, but
  the result is undefined.
- **Type coercion**: implicit casts in predicates can prevent index
  use. `WHERE id = '123'` against an `integer` column may scan.
- **Date/time**: store and compare in UTC; truncate explicitly
  (`date_trunc(...)`) rather than relying on session timezone.
- **Materialised views and triggers**: any new trigger or
  materialised view changes invariants on writes — call out the
  impact on existing call sites and refresh strategy.

## Anti-patterns / red flags

- String concatenation building a query (any language).
- `SELECT *` in production code paths.
- `OFFSET 100000` in user-facing pagination.
- `WHERE col = NULL` instead of `IS NULL`.
- `LEFT JOIN x ON ... WHERE x.col = 'y'` (filter forces inner join).
- Long-running `BEGIN ... COMMIT` spanning external calls.
- New `DELETE` without a `WHERE` clause review (or a `LIMIT`-style
  guard if the dialect supports it).
- `LIKE '%foo%'` on a hot path with no full-text index.
- `ORDER BY RAND()` / `ORDER BY random()` on a non-trivial table.
- New trigger, view, or stored procedure without a test that
  exercises it.
