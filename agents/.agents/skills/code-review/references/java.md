# Java review reference

Use when reviewing Java code in the diff. Apply this alongside the
main `code-review` skill workflow.

## Data-first bias (apply first)

The Java ecosystem grew up on mutable POJOs. The `data-first`
skill's doctrine is canonical:

- Prefer `record` (Java 14+) for value types over POJOs with getters
  and setters.
- Use `final` on fields, parameters, and locals by default; a
  non-final field that is never reassigned is a finding.
- Sealed classes / sealed interfaces (Java 17+) for sum types, with
  pattern-matching `switch` (Java 21+) instead of downcasting trees.
- `List.of(...)`, `Map.of(...)`, and `Collections.unmodifiableX`
  for read-only collections in public API.
- Push I/O into adapters; keep domain code pure and testable.
  Service classes that mutate shared fields outside construction are
  almost always wrong.

When in doubt, route to the `data-first` skill.

## Tooling that should be passing

- **Build**: `./mvnw verify` or `./gradlew check` runs
  compile + tests + static analysis.
- **Format**: `spotless:check` (Maven) / `spotlessCheck` (Gradle).
- **Static analysis**: `spotbugs`, `errorprone`, or PMD if the
  project uses them. New warnings introduced by the diff are
  findings.
- **Coverage**: project-defined gate (JaCoCo). Don't drop coverage
  silently.
- IDE warnings off / `@SuppressWarnings("...")` needs a reason in
  the comment.

## High-signal review checks

- **Null safety**:
  - `Optional<T>` is for return types where absence is meaningful.
    Don't use `Optional<T>` as a field, parameter, or in a
    collection.
  - Public API should not return `null`; return `Optional` or an
    empty collection.
  - `@Nullable` / `@NonNull` annotations help static analysis;
    new code should annotate boundaries.
- **Resource closing**: `try-with-resources` for any `Closeable` /
  `AutoCloseable`. A new `InputStream`, `Connection`, or
  `PreparedStatement` opened with no scoped close is a finding.
- **Exceptions**:
  - Expected domain failures use named checked/unchecked exception
    types or explicit result variants, not generic
    `RuntimeException("message")`.
  - Don't catch `Exception` / `Throwable` at random; be specific.
  - Don't throw from `finally` (swallows the original).
  - Wrapping a checked exception as `RuntimeException` requires a
    useful message and the cause chain (`new RuntimeException(msg,
    e)`, not `new RuntimeException(msg)`).
  - Custom exceptions extend `RuntimeException` for unchecked,
    `Exception` for checked — pick deliberately.
- **Concurrency**:
  - Shared mutable state across threads needs `volatile`,
    `AtomicX`, `java.util.concurrent` collections, or a `Lock` —
    never plain `HashMap`.
  - `synchronized` on `this` or on a public reference is a
    Critical-tier finding (callers can lock on the same monitor).
    Prefer a private `final Object lock = new Object();`.
  - Virtual threads (Java 21+): blocking is fine, but synchronized
    blocks pin the carrier — prefer `ReentrantLock`.
- **`equals` / `hashCode` / `toString`**: must move together.
  `record` gives them for free; manual overrides need tests.
  Inheritance + `equals` is a known minefield (see Effective Java).
- **Spring `@Transactional`**:
  - Self-invocation (`this.method()`) bypasses the proxy and the
    transaction.
  - `@Transactional` on a private/protected method is silently a
    no-op.
  - Default rollback only on `RuntimeException` — checked exceptions
    don't roll back unless declared (`rollbackFor = ...`).
- **Dependency injection**: prefer constructor injection over field
  injection (`@Autowired private Foo foo;`). Constructor-injected
  classes are testable without Spring; field-injected ones aren't.
- **Logging**: SLF4J parameter form (`log.info("user {} did x",
  id)`) over string concatenation — lazy evaluation, no leak when
  level is off.
- **Streams**: stateful lambda inside `map` / `filter` is a finding;
  parallel streams almost always need a justification (CPU-bound,
  no shared state, large enough to amortise the fork-join overhead).
- **`Date` / `Calendar`**: stay in `java.time` — `Instant`,
  `LocalDate`, `ZonedDateTime`. Legacy `Date` in new code is a
  finding.
- **Builds**: a new dependency in `pom.xml` / `build.gradle` should
  match a real need; transitive bumps deserve a glance for known
  CVEs.

## Anti-patterns / red flags

- `catch (Exception e) { /* log and continue */ }`.
- `synchronized(this)` or `synchronized` on a public reference.
- `@Transactional` on a private/protected method.
- Field injection (`@Autowired private Foo foo;`).
- `throw ex;` losing the cause chain.
- `Optional<T>` as a field or parameter.
- Mutable static state (`public static List<...> CACHE`).
- `String.format` / `+`-concat inside a log statement.
- New code using `java.util.Date` / `Calendar` / `SimpleDateFormat`.
- Returning `null` from a method whose contract says non-empty.
