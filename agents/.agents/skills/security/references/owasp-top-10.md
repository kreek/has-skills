# OWASP Top 10: category mitigations

Reference for the `security-review` skill. Each category: the risk, the
recurring failure pattern, and the concrete mitigations to check for in review.
Category names, IDs, and emphasis track the current edition of the OWASP Top 10.
Consult https://owasp.org/Top10/ before a review to confirm the list has not
shifted.

## A01: Broken Access Control

Failure pattern: the router authenticates but the handler forgets to authorise,
or the ORM fetches any row if the ID is known (IDOR).

Check:

- Authz is enforced in the handler, not only the router middleware.
- Every `findById` or equivalent is paired with an ownership or tenancy
  predicate (`where user_id = :current_user`).
- Role checks are positive allowlists; absence of a role = deny.
- Tests cover unauthenticated, wrong-tenant, and wrong-role callers on every
  protected path.

## A02: Security Misconfiguration

Failure pattern: frameworks shipped in debug/dev mode, default credentials left
enabled, permissive CORS, S3 bucket policies default-public, DB port exposed.

Check:

- `DEBUG = false` (or equivalent) in every non-dev environment.
- No default/sample credentials retained (`admin:admin`, `postgres:postgres`).
- CORS allowlist is explicit; no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on
  credentialed endpoints.
- Security headers present: `Content-Security-Policy`,
  `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
  `Referrer-Policy`.
- Cloud storage buckets are private-by-default; public access is explicitly
  documented.

## A03: Software Supply Chain Failures

Covers provenance, not just CVE presence. The concern is who built the artifact
and whether the build is reproducible, not only whether a known vulnerability is
listed.

Check:

- Lockfile pins exact versions; no floating ranges in production.
- Native dependency audit output is clean or findings are triaged.
- New transitive dependencies are explained in the PR.
- Build artifacts are signed (Sigstore/cosign) where supported.
- SLSA Level 2+ for critical services: build provenance attestations.
- SBOMs generated (`syft`, `cdxgen`) and stored with releases.

## A04: Cryptographic Failures

Failure pattern: roll-your-own crypto, MD5/SHA1 still in use, RSA without
padding, hardcoded IVs, missing constant-time comparison.

Check:

- No custom crypto, hash, MAC, or token formats.
- Password hashing: argon2id (preferred), scrypt, or bcrypt cost ≥12.
- Symmetric: AEAD only (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305); never CBC+HMAC hand-rolled.
- Asymmetric: Ed25519 for signing; RSA-2048+ with PSS or OAEP if RSA is
  required.
- Key storage: KMS-managed; no plaintext keys in env vars or code.
- Constant-time comparison for token, MAC, or capability equality
  (`crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`, `hmac.compare_digest`,
  `crypto.timingSafeEqual`).

## A05: Injection

Covers SQL, NoSQL, OS command, LDAP, expression-language, template, and log
injection.

Check:

- SQL: parameterised queries only; no string concatenation of user-controlled
  data into SQL.
- OS: no `shell=True`, no `os.system`, no `exec` on string-interpolated
  commands; pass argv arrays.
- LDAP/XML/XPath: library-provided parameterisation.
- Logs: never interpolate user input into a log format string; pass as a
  structured field.
- SSTI: templates compiled from user input = bug.

## A06: Insecure Design

Failure pattern: the threat model was never written; the design doc assumes the
happy path.

Check:

- New endpoints have an STRIDE pass attached to the design doc.
- Rate limiting is designed before the endpoint ships, not after.
- Privileged paths have separate authz checks, not shared middleware.
- Abuse cases are listed alongside use cases.

## A07: Authentication Failures

Covers credential stuffing, session fixation, weak password policies, missing
MFA on privileged roles.

Check:

- Password policy: min 15, max ≥64, printable Unicode + spaces, no composition
  rules, breached-password check on set/change.
- Rate limit and account lockout on failed logins.
- Session ID rotated on login and privilege change; short idle timeout for
  privileged sessions.
- MFA required for any admin or privileged role; phishing-resistant factor
  (WebAuthn/passkeys) preferred.
- SMS OTP is a fallback only, never sole factor.

## A08: Software or Data Integrity Failures

Covers unsigned updates, deserialisation of untrusted data, CI/CD pipeline
tampering.

Check:

- Auto-update channels verify signatures before install.
- No deserialisation of untrusted input via `pickle`, Java serialisation, PHP
  `unserialize`, Node `vm.runInNewContext`, etc.
- CI/CD secrets scoped by environment; prod secrets never loaded in PR builds.
- Artifacts signed; consumers verify before deploy.

## A09: Security Logging and Alerting Failures

Failure pattern: ample logs that record the wrong things: user secrets appear,
but auth denials don't.

Check:

- Log authn success/failure, authz denials, admin actions, boundary validation
  rejections: with request ID and actor, not raw payload.
- Never log passwords, tokens, session IDs, raw PII, full payment data.
- Alerts configured on failed-login spikes, privilege escalations, new admin
  creation, unexpected outbound connections.
- Retention meets policy; logs are tamper-evident (append-only, optionally
  hash-chained).

## A10: Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions

Covers information disclosure through error messages, missing auth checks in
error paths, and timing differences that enumerate valid users or tokens.

Check:

- Generic error to caller; detail only in server-side log with request ID.
- No stack traces, SQL fragments, or file paths in HTTP responses.
- **Same shape and same timing** on authn failure paths (user-not-found vs
  wrong-password).
- Error handlers re-check auth before returning; no "fall through" on exception
  to a less-privileged path.
- Panics in privileged code paths terminate the process; they do not silently
  recover.
