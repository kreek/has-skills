# Modern CSS: frontend-design

Browser support is a moving target: treat MDN Baseline and the linked
browser-compat tables as the source of truth before shipping production code
that depends on a newer feature.

---

## Baseline widely available: use without feature query

- **Cascade layers**:
  `@layer reset, base, tokens, layout, components, utilities;`
- **Native nesting**: `&` selector.
- **Container queries**: `@container` with `container-type: inline-size`, units
  `cqi` / `cqw` / `cqh`.
- **`:has()`**: relational selector.
- **Subgrid**.
- **View Transitions Level 1**: same-document SPA transitions.
- **`color-mix()`**.
- **OKLCH** and **oklab**.
- **`light-dark()`** with `color-scheme`.
- **`@starting-style`** with `transition-behavior: allow-discrete`: enter /
  exit from `display:none`.
- **HTML Popover API**: `popover`, `popovertarget`.
- **`field-sizing: content`**: auto-sizing inputs.
- **`text-wrap: balance`** on headings. **`text-wrap: pretty`** on paragraphs.
- **`@property`**: typed custom properties.
- **`dvh` / `svh` / `lvh`** viewport units.

## Use with `@supports` or progressive enhancement

Verify these features against the linked source before relying on them. Prefer
semantic fallback markup and small `@supports` blocks over browser sniffing.

| Feature                            | Production posture                                                                                               | Source anchor                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| View Transitions Level 2 (MPA)     | Progressive enhancement only; same-document transitions are safer as a default.                                  | https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/              |
| CSS Anchor Positioning             | Useful for popovers/tooltips, but check each property/function because Baseline status can differ by subfeature. | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/anchor      |
| Scroll-driven animations           | Use for non-essential motion only; provide a static layout and honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.                   | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_scroll-driven_animations |
| `interpolate-size: allow-keywords` | Enhancement for smoother intrinsic-size animation; do not make layout depend on it.                              | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/interpolate-size             |
| `@scope`                           | Good for local cascade control; verify support and remember inheritance still crosses scope boundaries.          | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/%40scope                     |
| `display: grid-lanes` (masonry)    | Experimental/early-adopter feature; do not use for critical production layout without a robust fallback.         | https://webkit.org/blog/17862/webkit-features-for-safari-26-4/                |

## CSS architecture

The plain-CSS renaissance is real. Nesting + layers + custom properties have
made many teams abandon runtime CSS-in-JS (incompatible with React Server
Components; bundle cost).

Current defaults:

- **Tailwind CSS v4**: CSS-first config via `@theme {}`, Lightning CSS engine.
  Dominates in practice. https://tailwindcss.com/
- **shadcn/ui + Tailwind + CVA**: default React stack. https://ui.shadcn.com/
- **Vanilla Extract**: zero-runtime typed styles.
  https://vanilla-extract.style/
- **Panda CSS**: https://panda-css.com/
- **StyleX** (Meta): https://stylexjs.com/
- **CUBE CSS** (Andy Bell): BEM-style discipline at scale. https://cube.fyi/
- **ITCSS** (Harry Roberts): inverted-triangle organisation; maps naturally
  onto `@layer`. https://csswizardry.com/2018/11/itcss-and-skillshare/

---

## Responsive strategy

- **Fluid typography via `clamp()`**: Utopia approach. Replaces
  breakpoint-stacked type scales.
  `--step-0: clamp(1rem, 0.93rem + 0.33vi, 1.19rem);` https://utopia.fyi/
- **Container queries**: replace many media queries for component
  responsiveness.
- **Intrinsic Web Design** (Jen Simmons). Default card grid:
  `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(100%, 20rem), 1fr))`.
- **Logical properties**: `margin-inline`, `padding-block`,
  `inset-inline-start`. i18n-ready default.
- **Grid for 2D page and component structure. Flex for 1D content flows.**

---

## Performance rules

- **Animate only `transform`, `opacity`, `filter`.** Compositor-only. Layout
  properties are expensive every frame.
- `will-change: transform` only transiently. Remove after the animation.
- `content-visibility: auto` + `contain-intrinsic-size` for long pages.
- Inline critical CSS above the fold.
- Never animate `box-shadow` directly. Transition opacity of a pre-rendered
  shadow layer instead.
- Houdini Paint / Layout Worklets have stalled outside Chromium. Do not invest
  for cross-browser work.

---

## FLIP technique

First, Last, Invert, Play. Measure before and after, apply an inverting
transform, remove with transition.

Underlies:

- Framer Motion's `layout` prop.
- Svelte's `animate:flip`.
- Every shared-element transition library.

## View Transitions

Same-document (SPA):

```js
document.startViewTransition(() => updateDOM());
```

Cross-document (MPA, same origin only):

```css
@view-transition {
  navigation: auto;
}
```

Give shared elements matching `view-transition-name` values. The browser
interpolates position, size, opacity for free.

Customise with `::view-transition-old(name)` and `::view-transition-new(name)`
pseudo-elements.

## Motion libraries

- **Motion**: https://motion.dev/, Matt Perry's successor to Framer Motion /
  Motion One. WAAPI where possible, JS fallback. React, Vue, vanilla bindings.
- **GSAP**: https://gsap.com/, 100% free including all former Club plugins.
  Use for timeline orchestration, scroll choreography, SVG / canvas.
- **Svelte transitions**: shipped in the framework. No install.
- **Lottie**: https://airbnb.io/lottie/, illustrative After Effects exports.
  Overkill for UI.
