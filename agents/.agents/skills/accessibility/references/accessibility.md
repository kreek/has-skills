# Accessibility

WCAG 2.2 AA is the floor. Depth reference for the rules summarised in
`SKILL.md`.

---

## POUR principles

W3C Recommendation; also published as ISO/IEC 40500. Quoted verbatim from
https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/ :

> **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be
> presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
>
> **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable.
>
> **Understandable**: Information and the operation of user interface must be
> understandable.
>
> **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably
> by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

WCAG 2.2 is additive to 2.1. Removes the obsolete 4.1.1 Parsing success
criterion.

## WCAG 3.0 status

A Working Draft, retitled _W3C Accessibility Guidelines_ (same acronym). **Do
not use for compliance until it reaches W3C Recommendation status**: check the
W3C status page before relying on it.

Preview of structural changes:

- Outcomes replace binary success criteria.
- Bronze / Silver / Gold conformance tiers.
- APCA as the candidate contrast method.

Ref: https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/

## Semantic HTML first

- `<button>` for in-page actions.
- `<a href>` for navigation.
- Native `<dialog>` with `.showModal()`: handles focus trap and `inert`
  automatically.
- `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>` for landmarks.
- One `<h1>` per page. Don't skip levels.
- `<label for>` paired with `<input id>` always. Never rely on `placeholder`.
- `<fieldset>` + `<legend>` for grouped inputs.

## ARIA

### The First Rule of ARIA

Quoted from https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/read-me-first/ :

> "If you can use a native HTML element or attribute with the semantics and
> behavior you require already built in, instead of re-purposing an element and
> adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so."

WebAIM Million data: sites using ARIA average **41% more** detected
accessibility errors than those without. No ARIA is better than bad ARIA.
https://webaim.org/projects/million/

### The Five Rules

1. Prefer native HTML.
2. Don't change native semantics unless necessary.
3. All interactive ARIA must be keyboard-accessible.
4. Never put `role="presentation"` or `aria-hidden="true"` on a focusable
   element.
5. Every interactive element needs an accessible name.

### APG patterns to implement faithfully

Dialog, Combobox, Listbox, Menu / Menubar, Tabs, Accordion, Disclosure, Tooltip,
Switch, Treegrid: with their prescribed keyboard maps.

Ref: https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/

---

## Keyboard navigation

- `tabindex="0"` to add to natural order.
- `tabindex="-1"` for programmatically focusable only.
- **Never positive tabindex.**
- Show focus rings via `:focus-visible`, not `:focus`: `outline: none` for
  mouse is acceptable only with `:focus-visible` rings.
- Implement skip links:
  `<a class="skip-link" href="#main">Skip to main content</a>`.
- Use **roving tabindex** for composite widgets (tabs, listboxes, menus, radio
  groups).
- Restore focus on modal close.

## User-preference media queries

Honour these; do not override:

| Query                            | Action                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` | Keep subtle fades. Kill parallax, large scale changes. Do not nuke all animation: vestibular users often benefit from orienting transforms                                        |
| `prefers-color-scheme: dark`     | Theme. Provide manual override.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `prefers-contrast: more`         | Raise contrast.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `prefers-reduced-transparency`   | Turn off backdrop blur.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `forced-colors: active`          | Windows High Contrast. Use CSS system colours: `Canvas`, `CanvasText`, `LinkText`, `ButtonFace`, `ButtonText`, `Highlight`. Never `forced-color-adjust: none` unless unavoidable. |

| Screen reader | Browser           |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| NVDA          | Firefox, Chrome   |
| VoiceOver     | Safari            |

Automated tools (axe DevTools, WAVE, Lighthouse, Accessibility Insights) catch
~30–40% of issues. Always follow with manual keyboard and screen-reader passes.

## Inclusive design

Microsoft's **Inclusive Design**: https://inclusive.microsoft.design/

Principles:

1. Recognise exclusion.
2. Learn from diversity.
3. Solve for one, extend to many.

**Persona spectrum**: permanent, temporary, and situational variants of every
disability. Captions (designed for Deaf users) serve people in noisy bars,
language learners, and parents with sleeping infants.
