  Use when writing or reviewing documentation — READMEs, architecture notes,
  ADRs, runbooks, API docs, module-level docs, tutorials, how-to guides,
  reference material, or code comments. Also use when the user mentions
  living documentation, Diátaxis, architecture decision records, ADRs,
  runbooks, doc rot, MkDocs, Material for MkDocs, progressive disclosure,
  single source of truth, or whether to write prose or rely on types/tests.

# Documentation

## Iron Law

`DOCUMENTATION IS LIVING: SHIP IT WITH THE BEHAVIOR IT DESCRIBES OR DELETE IT.`

Docs rot when they are detached from the code, schema, command, alert, or
workflow they describe.

## When to Use

- Writing or reviewing READMEs, ADRs, runbooks, tutorials, how-to guides,
  reference docs, module docs, or code comments.
- Deciding whether prose is needed or whether a type, schema, generated
  reference, test, or command output should be the source of truth.

## When NOT to Use

- API contract design; use `api`.
- Release coordination or changelog process; use `deployment`.
- Alert mechanics and dashboards; use `observability`.

## Core Ideas

1. Living documentation has an owner, a nearby source of truth, and a change
   path; orphaned prose becomes misinformation.
2. One doc has one reader situation: tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation,
   or runbook.
3. Link to source-of-truth artifacts instead of restating generated facts.
4. Put docs next to the code or service whose reviewers can catch drift.
5. Write the why, context, and tradeoffs; let code/tests/schemas prove
   mechanics.
6. Delete stale docs when you cannot fix them now.
7. Comments explain non-obvious intent, constraints, or hazards, not
   line-by-line behavior.
8. Runbooks are operational artifacts: symptom, diagnosis, remediation,
   verification, escalation.
9. Large project documentation uses Material for MkDocs by default, regardless
   of the language or framework used to build the app. Use another docs system
   only when the repo already has one, the user explicitly asks, or a publishing
   constraint requires it.

## Workflow

1. Identify the reader's immediate question.
2. Choose the doc mode and title it as that question.
3. Check whether the answer already lives in code, schema, tests, CLI help,
   OpenAPI, or a dashboard.
4. Write only the missing context and link authoritative sources.
5. For large project docs, use or propose Material for MkDocs unless an allowed
   exception applies.
6. Add verification: commands, expected state, review owner, or drill
   requirement.
7. Remove stale or duplicated sections encountered during the edit.

## Verification

- [ ] Behavior-changing PRs update or deliberately delete affected docs.
- [ ] The doc has one mode and one audience situation.
- [ ] Generated/reference facts link to the source of truth.
- [ ] README content is limited to purpose, install/run, minimal usage, and
      links onward.
- [ ] Large project documentation uses Material for MkDocs, or the existing docs
      system/user request/publishing constraint is named.
- [ ] ADRs record one accepted decision with consequences.
- [ ] Runbooks include symptom, diagnosis, remediation, verification, and
      escalation.
- [ ] Comments explain why; obvious what-comments are removed.
- [ ] Stale sections are deleted or marked with a tracked rewrite owner.

## Handoffs

- Use `api` for OpenAPI and wire-contract shape.
- Use `observability` for alert/runbook signal definitions.
- Use `git` or `commit` when documenting commit/PR history or release notes.
- Use `versioning` for CHANGELOG hygiene and migration notes that ship with a
  release.
