# Link Shortener

Build a small link-shortener app. The scaffold ships only `package.json`,
a placeholder `README.md`, and a trivial smoke test.

## Requirements

### Backend

- Entry point: `src/server.js` exporting a default startup that listens on
  `process.env.PORT` (default 3000). The npm `start` script already calls
  `node --experimental-sqlite src/server.js`.
- Persist links in SQLite using the built-in `node:sqlite` module. A
  `data/links.db` file is acceptable; an in-memory DB is also acceptable
  as long as the same instance handles all requests in one process.
- Schema: at minimum `slug TEXT PRIMARY KEY`, `url TEXT NOT NULL`,
  `created_at INTEGER`, `click_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0`.

### HTTP routes

- `GET /` — HTML page with an HTMX form that POSTs to `/shorten`.
- `POST /shorten` — accepts JSON `{ "url": "..." }` *or* form-encoded
  `url=...`. Validates the URL (see Security). On success returns the
  slug; the response may be JSON `{ "slug": "...", "shortUrl": "..." }`
  or an HTMX-friendly HTML fragment, but the slug must appear in the
  response body. On rejection, return a 4xx with a useful message.
- `GET /:slug` — 302 redirect to the stored URL. Increments
  `click_count`. 404 for unknown slugs.
- `GET /admin` — HTML page listing all links and click counts.

### Frontend

- `public/index.html` — load HTMX and Alpine from CDN; HTMX form for
  creating links; show the resulting short URL inline; one Alpine
  component (e.g. copy-to-clipboard) is enough.
- `public/admin.html` (or merged into `/admin`) — list of links;
  HTMX-driven refresh is preferred but not required.

### Security

- Reject non-HTTP(S) target URLs (`javascript:`, `data:`, `file:`).
- Reject URL forms that the WHATWG URL parser leniently accepts:
  scheme without slashes (`https:host`), one slash (`https:/host`),
  scheme-relative (`//host`), backslash-prefixed, percent-encoded slash
  variants. Validate the input string form before parsing.
- Use parameterised SQL; never interpolate user input into queries.
- Slugs the server *generates* must be URL-safe (alphanumeric and `-_`).

### Tests

- Behavior tests at the seams. Both happy paths and the rejection cases
  above. Tests should boot the server (or use the exported handler /
  factory) and exercise the endpoints; do not test private helpers in
  isolation if the seam tests already cover them.

Do not add external dependencies beyond what the scaffold ships.
