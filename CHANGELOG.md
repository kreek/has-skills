# Changelog

All notable changes to Consult are recorded here. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [11.4.0] (2026-05-25)

### Changed

- Made `contract-first` own designing the concrete contract instead of deferring
  it to `specify`. The skill had framed itself as an approval gate, "not a design
  conversation," and ejected to `specify` whenever the shape was still being
  explored, but `specify` defers concrete interfaces back to `contract-first`, so
  agents bounced contract design away too easily. Working out the actual
  signatures, types, and shapes is now stated as `contract-first`'s own job;
  ejecting to `specify` is reserved for when the broader approach is unsettled.
- Reshaped `contract-first` Core Ideas to follow the order an engineer reasons
  about a contract: recognize what makes a shape a contract, then design and gate
  it, then bound what approval covers. The recognition rule was a dangling
  fragment and is now a definitional judgment rule; the routing-to-`specify`
  content moved to When NOT to Use and Handoffs.

## [11.3.0] (2026-05-25)

### Changed

- Restructured `workflow`'s steps into a clean engineering progression: frame
  the request, classify the work by stakes, set the involvement level, load
  skills, gate durable decisions, slice the work, run the completion loop, and
  close. The previous order forced the agent to set involvement and name gates
  before classifying the work, choices the later steps then reversed.
- Gave the gate doctrine one home. The rule that an approving design or RFC does
  not approve the concrete interfaces and domain shapes under it now lives in
  the step-5 gate table and is referenced from Verification and Tripwires
  instead of being restated in roughly six places.
- Strengthened the completion loop: it now proves every behavior with specs via
  `proof` before running at least one `code-review` self-review pass, repeating
  until the specs pass and the review is clean. Added a matching Verification
  checkbox and flipped the `code-review` self-review note to the same
  proof-before-review order.
- Reworded the `workflow` tripwires in plain language.

## [11.2.1] (2026-05-25)

### Changed

- Rewrote `workflow` step 1 as a pure request router. It now names the level of
  user involvement the request needs (autonomous, brief updates, or
  options-and-approval before significant or durable decisions) and routes
  review or critique requests to `code-review`, replacing four capitalized mode
  labels (Direct, Guided, Design-partner, Review-only) that were defined and
  referenced nowhere.

## [11.2.0] (2026-05-25)

### Changed

- Bound the contract-first interface gate to implementation rather than design
  sign-off: approving a `specify` design or RFC no longer counts as approval of
  the concrete caller-facing surfaces invented during the build; each surface is
  listed for its own approve/revise/reject before it is written.
- Made `domain-modeling`'s durable core shape a real approval gate. It now
  appears in `workflow`'s enumeration of decisions needing human sign-off and
  carries its own sign-off step and verification, closing the gap where a
  non-caller-facing domain model from an approved RFC had no gate.
- Extended the "an approving design or RFC approves the direction, not the
  concrete shape" rule to `architecture` (module boundaries, shared structure,
  project layout) and `database` (schema, migration, destructive data changes)
  so every durable-decision gate states it uniformly.
- Reworded `workflow` Core Idea 3 to "consult before significant or durable
  decisions" so the headline names both gate axes instead of the abstract
  "hard-to-change work".

## [11.1.2] (2026-05-25)

### Changed

- Reframed `workflow` Core Idea 6 from "Compose over repeat" to "Don't repeat
  yourself" so it names the DRY principle directly instead of sharing the
  "Compose over" lead with idea 5.
- Removed em dashes across all skills and the README, CONTRIBUTING, and
  CHANGELOG, replacing each with a colon, comma, semicolon, or parentheses, and
  normalized the scaffolding stack YAML titles to a consistent comma form.
- Clarified `proof` contract-first testing: skip unit tests that would mostly
  restate helper internals already covered through a handoff, and test the
  contract so refactors can preserve behavior without rewriting proof.

### Added

- Added a project-local Codex `$ship` maintainer skill at
  `.agents/skills/ship/SKILL.md` for this repository's guarded release flow,
  documented in AGENTS.md. Repo-local tooling only: not part of the published
  Consult skill pack.

## [11.1.1] (2026-05-25)

### Changed

- Tightened the `workflow` skill description from "almost every coding task" to
  "every coding task" so the routing trigger reads unambiguously.

### Added

- Added `make update-installed-plugins` / `update-installed-plugins-dry-run`
  targets and the `scripts/update-installed-plugins.sh` helper to refresh
  installed plugins through each agent's official update path, with CONTRIBUTING
  notes and tests. Dev tooling only: not part of the published plugin or npm
  package.

## [11.1.0] (2026-05-25)

### Changed

- Strengthened the `workflow` skill trigger so Consult is used first for almost
  every coding task, including scaffolding, feature work, debugging, UI, tests,
  config, CI, dependencies, APIs, services, web apps, and read-only code
  questions unless they are truly trivial.

## [11.0.1] (2026-05-25)

### Fixed

- Rescoped the `workflow` consultation guidance so it gates the durable
  decisions skills produce (a `specify` design direction, a `contract-first`
  interface, a `database` migration or destructive data change, a `release`
  artifact, and history-changing or destructive `git-workflow`) rather than
  the act of loading a skill. Reasoning with `domain-modeling` no longer reads
  as needing human approval.
- Harmonized the `specify` bug-fix carve-out with `workflow` and the README:
  narrow bug fixes that restore intended behavior, not "single-line" fixes.

## [11.0.0] (2026-05-24)

### Changed

- Renamed the pack from Highline Agent Skills to **Consult** across the README,
  AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, skill prose, and plugin/marketplace
  display metadata, and clarified the README intro framing and guidance. This
  is a deliberate major-version milestone marking the rebrand. Plugin IDs
  (`consult`), slash commands (`/consult:*`), and npm package names are
  unchanged, so the bump is non-breaking for existing installs.

## [10.5.1] (2026-05-24)

### Changed

- Clarified `workflow` request routing: spelled out the Direct, Guided,
  Design-partner, and Review-only modes and which work normally needs explicit
  human approval before implementation.

## [10.5.0] (2026-05-24)

### Changed

- Broadened the human-in-the-loop gate so significant work, not only
  hard-to-change boundaries, gets a plan or shape/API sign-off before
  implementation. `workflow`, `specify`, and `contract-first` now treat a
  substantial new module or component, non-trivial logic, or a deliberate
  observable behavior change as consultative; routine, local, and disposable
  work (including narrow bug fixes that restore already-intended behavior)
  stays autonomous.
- Renamed the GitHub repository to `kreek/consult`. Updated install URLs,
  clone paths, and plugin/package metadata accordingly. Plugin IDs, slash
  commands, and npm package names are unchanged.

## [10.4.0] (2026-05-23)

### Changed

- Renamed the pack to **Highline Agent Skills** (**HAS**) across README,
  AGENTS.md, skill prose, plugin display metadata, eval docs, and install
  URLs (`kreek/highline-agent-skills`). Plugin IDs (`abp`), slash commands
  (`/abp:*`), and npm package names are unchanged.


### Added

- Cursor plugin packaging: `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json` and
  `plugin/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` (skills-only), plus README install,
  CONTRIBUTING local dev and marketplace submission notes, and a `setup.sh`
  warning when a Cursor plugin and manual `~/.agents/skills/` install would
  duplicate skills.

## [10.1.0] (2026-05-20)

### Changed

- Clarified the `commit` skill so agents group commits by behavior, not by
  branch, and added `Core Ideas` guidance for reader-facing history.

## [10.0.0] (2026-05-20)

### Changed

- Removed Claude Code and Codex plugin Stop hooks so Consult plugin packages are
  skills-only. Self-review remains part of the `workflow` completion loop, and
  the Pi package keeps its `/consult:self-review` runtime command.

## [9.12.0] (2026-05-16)

### Changed

- Cap the Consult self-review Stop hook at 3 firings per `session_id` to
  prevent doom loops when the model addresses the reminder by editing more
  files (changing the diff hash) without using an acknowledgement token.
  Configurable via `Consult_SELF_REVIEW_MAX_RUNS` (default `3`). State file
  shape extended from `{ sessionId: "hash" }` to
  `{ sessionId: { hash, count } }`; legacy string entries are read
  transparently and migrate on the next write.
- Foreground component handoffs as the primary proof target in the
  `proof` skill. New Core Idea names parser → validator → domain →
  persistence, service → service, producer → queue → consumer, and
  functional-core → imperative-shell seams as where production defects
  concentrate. The outermost caller boundary is reframed as the outermost
  handoff. A new Core Idea makes the TDD departure explicit: when data,
  logic, and I/O are separated and units stay pure, unit tests stay slim
  by design; internal helpers are exercised by handoff tests above them.
  `references/data-shape-boundaries.md` is now named as the canonical
  handoff reference. `contract-first`, `architecture`, `async-systems`,
  `domain-modeling`, and `api` Handoffs sections now route handoff-proof
  in caller language.

## [9.11.0] (2026-05-16)

### Changed

- Stop hook reframed from a narrow proof reminder into a final-pass
  self-review. The injected message now routes the model into the
  `consult:code-review` skill and asks for a findings-first severity pass
  across correctness, security, evidence, dead-surface / AI-risk, and
  simplicity lenses (with handoff to `consult:proof` for missing coverage).
  Gating semantics (production-file-only, once-per-session-hash,
  git-aware, Stop-only) are unchanged.
- Hook script renamed `plugin/scripts/proof-reminder.mjs` →
  `plugin/scripts/self-review.mjs`; test renamed in lockstep.
  Acknowledgement tokens broadened: `self-review:` and `findings:` join
  the existing `proof:`, `evidence:`, `unproven`. State file
  `~/.consult-proof-gate-state.json` → `~/.consult-self-review-state.json`;
  env override `Consult_PROOF_GATE_STATE_FILE` →
  `Consult_SELF_REVIEW_STATE_FILE`.

## [9.10.3] (2026-05-15)

### Fixed

- Proof-reminder Stop hook was emitting
  `hookSpecificOutput: { hookEventName: "Stop" }`, which Claude Code's
  hook-output schema does not allow (`hookSpecificOutput` is only
  defined for `PreToolUse`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PostToolUse`, and
  `PostToolBatch`). Validation rejected the whole JSON, so the
  reminder never reached the model. Drop the field and rely on the
  top-level `decision` and `reason` only.

## [9.10.2] (2026-05-15)

### Removed

- The `proof`, `review`, and `workflow` slash-command wrappers (in
  `plugin/commands/` and the canonical `agents/.agents/commands/`).
  Claude Code already exposes each skill as its own slash command, so
  the wrappers showed up as duplicate `/proof`, `/review`, and
  `/workflow` entries. Trigger the skills directly instead.
- Symlink generator and skill-anatomy validator branches that mirrored
  and checked the deleted command files, plus their tests.

## [9.10.1] (2026-05-15)

### Fixed

- Stop hook crash under Claude Code (`Cannot find module
  '/scripts/proof-reminder.mjs'`). The Codex hooks file
  (`plugin/hooks/hooks.json`, which uses the Codex-only
  `${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT}` placeholder) sat on the path Claude Code
  auto-discovers, so Claude Code loaded it alongside the correct inline
  hook from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and the unsubstituted
  placeholder collapsed to an absolute `/scripts/...` path. Moved the
  Codex hooks file to `plugin/.codex-plugin/hooks.json` and updated the
  Codex plugin manifest reference, leaving Claude Code with only the
  working `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`-based hook.

## [9.10.0] (2026-05-15)

### Added

- Light-touch end-of-turn proof reminder hook on the Claude Code and Codex
  plugin (`Stop` event). Interrupts once per task when production code
  changed and the agent has not named proof, pointing at the `consult:proof`
  skill. Honors `stop_hook_active` to avoid infinite loops; idempotent per
  session via a state file at `~/.consult-proof-gate-state.json`
  (override with `Consult_PROOF_GATE_STATE_FILE`). Skips silently on
  docs/config-only diffs, clean trees, non-git directories, and when the
  agent has already named proof in its last message. Codex users must
  enable `[features] hooks = true` in `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- Narrow `agents/AGENTS.md` carve-out permitting completion-gate hooks
  that ride on the host's native turn-end event and inject skill-aligned
  reminders only.

## [9.9.0] (2026-05-15)

### Changed

- BREAKING: Renamed the `technical-design` skill, `/skill:technical-design`
  invocation, Pi guard command `/consult:technical-design`, and
  `consult-technical-design` runtime package to `specify`,
  `/skill:specify`, `/consult:specify`, and
  `consult-specify`. Specify keeps the design-before-code
  conversation guard, routes durable interfaces through `contract-first`, and
  captures the agreed result as an ADR, RFC, tech spec, or note.
- Workflow guidance now separates work-location choices by branch state: on
  `main`/`master`, create a new branch or create a separate worktree and
  branch; on topic branches with distinct work, continue here, branch from
  this branch, or create a separate worktree from main. It also requires
  explicit compatibility decisions for public renames/removals, treats release
  prep as separate from implementation approval, and defers `release` to
  explicit release-prep requests or post-implementation/code-review checks so
  startup routing cannot silently expand into npm/version/changelog work.
- Renamed the `data-first` skill to `domain-modeling`. The new
  `contract-first` skill (Pi Interface Design Gate) owns the temporal
  "first" position in the workflow; `data-first` was always a doctrine
  about data shapes, invariants, parsing, and effect isolation rather
  than ordering, so the name now matches what the skill teaches.
  Cross-references in canonical skills, AGENTS, README, the npm package
  README, and the eval harness have been updated. The plugin mirror at
  `plugin/skills/` is regenerated from canonical.
- Promoted the workflow-only official-source rule into a canonical
  `official-source-check` skill. `workflow`, `agents/AGENTS.md`, and README
  now route framework, library, runtime, SDK, browser, cloud, and platform
  checks through that skill instead of hiding the rule in a reference file.

## [5.1.0] (2026-05-08)

### Added

- `scaffolding` now ships a `java/service-quarkus` Backstage stack template
  for native-ready JVM services with Quarkus REST, CDI, Gradle, JUnit 5,
  RestAssured, Panache, observability, auth, scheduler, and native-image
  choices.
- `workflow` now includes a version-verified implementation reference for
  version-sensitive framework, library, runtime, and platform work.
- `workflow` now includes a simple-not-easy doctrine reference for avoiding
  ceremony, over-broad skill loading, and hidden coupling disguised as safety.
- `data-first` now ships a `complecting.md` reference: a smell catalog with
  AST-level signals (mutable field + reader + writer = state/identity/value
  braid; switch-on-tag braids who/what; ORM lazy associations braid object
  and relational semantics; setter/getter pairs; mutating builders;
  singletons; pass-through parameters; etc.) and the smallest disentangling
  move per smell. Cross-cited by `code-review` for diff sweeps.
- `refactoring` now ships a `connascence.md` reference: the Page-Jones /
  Weirich axes (Name → Type → Meaning → Position → Algorithm → Execution →
  Timing → Identity) with strength, locality, and degree dimensions, used
  to score whether a refactor weakens coupling, reduces degree, or
  tightens locality. Cross-cited by `architecture` and `code-review`.
- `workflow` now ships a `vocabulary-map.md` reference: a crosswalk from
  SOLID, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal / Ports & Adapters, and DDD
  vocabulary into the Consult simplicity-shaped implementation, so the agent
  meets the user's dialect at design time rather than asserting a
  competing one at PR review. Cross-cited by `architecture`, `data-first`,
  `refactoring`, and `code-review`.
- `release` now includes a deprecation and migration reference covering
  advisory deprecation, compulsory migration, removal, and recovery proof.
- New Pi runtime package `consult-contract-first@1.0.0` hosts
  the Interface Design Gate as a soft runtime check that pauses
  mutating tool calls when interface/contract intent appears without
  an approved gate packet. Pairs with the `whiteboarding` and
  `workflow` skills.
- New meta-package `consult` (Pi-installable) depends on
  `consult-skills`, `consult-contract-first`, and
  `consult-proof`. One-command install for the full Consult-on-Pi
  experience.
- `consult-whiteboard` now includes a Pi final-response guard that
  asks agents to explain what changed, why it is better than what came before,
  and what it enables next after implementation work.

### Changed

- BREAKING (Pi): `pi-consult` is renamed to
  `consult-skills`@5.0.0 and is skills-only; Pi runtime
  extensions live in sibling packages now. The old
  `pi-consult` npm name is deprecated pointing at the new
  name; existing installs keep working until upgrade.
- BREAKING (Pi): `pi-proof` is renamed to `consult-proof`@2.0.0
  and is now built/published from this monorepo at
  `consult-proof/` instead of the standalone `kreek/pi-proof`
  repo. The old `pi-proof` npm name is deprecated pointing at the new
  name; package contents are functionally unchanged.
- BREAKING: Skills are consolidated to reduce Codex skill-list context
  pressure: `git` + `commit` -> `git-workflow`, `deployment` +
  `versioning` -> `release`, `concurrency` + `realtime` +
  `background-jobs` -> `async-systems`, `caching` -> `performance`,
  and `testing` -> `proof`.
- Consult routing doctrine is now described as quality-driven and risk-triggered:
  `workflow` is the entry point, `proof` is both the completion gate and a
  proof-work skill, and other skills are peers selected by quality concern.
- Consult now treats durable interfaces as contract/API sign-off gates: agents
  must design the boundary, propose the contract, and get user approval
  before implementation continues. In practice this means more pause/approve
  loops than 4.12.0; expect agents to stop on any new exported type, prop,
  schema, endpoint, or migration that crosses a module boundary. Internal-only
  exports and one-module refactors do not trip the gate.
- Adds `whiteboarding` skill: a mandatory pre-code artifact that maps current
  and proposed contracts (function signatures, schemas, events, CLI, config,
  types) and surfaces resolved decisions and open questions before any
  non-trivial change. `architecture` is now downstream of `whiteboarding`.
- Versioning guidance now treats optional additive public-surface changes as
  minor unless they force existing callers to change or accept new semantics;
  this guidance now lives in `release`.
- Workflow completion guidance now requires agents to explain what they changed,
  why it improves on the previous state, and/or what it enables next.
- Git workflow guidance now recommends a separate worktree when parallel
  work is expected, or when an in-flight branch has work that overlaps
  with or should stay separate from a new task; this guidance now lives
  in `git-workflow`.
- Skill frontmatter descriptions may now be up to 120 characters each, with a
  2,000-character pack-wide description budget enforced by the validator.
- `api` now treats continuation tokens such as cursors, page tokens, sync
  tokens, and resume tokens as caller input and requires explicit
  invalid-token behavior instead of silent position fallback.
- `workflow` now includes a documentation check in the completion loop, and
  `documentation` clarifies when explanatory comments should capture
  non-obvious why/how context without encouraging comment-count targets.
- Consult doctrine now explicitly says skills ride on host harnesses rather than
  replacing browser control, delegation, tool use, memory, planning, or
  system-prompt orchestration.
- `workflow` now separates internal Consult skill routing from user-facing
  readiness notes, so agents translate skills into domain lenses and exclude
  product scope instead of listing irrelevant tools.
- `documentation` now supports refining vague product ideas into problem,
  audience, smallest useful outcome, non-goals, assumptions, and proof before
  whiteboarding or implementation.
- `security`, `workflow`, `code-review`, and `refactoring` now make context
  trust and simplification guidance more concrete.
- Eval commands now use the Pi Do Eval **Bench**, **Regression**, and
  **Trial** vocabulary; the duplicate experiment command/scripts and config
  surface were removed.
- Consult eval suites now use Pi Do Eval's file-backed `eval/suites/*.yaml`
  workflow; `eval.config.ts` is limited to profile, Bench, judge, timeout,
  and budget policy.
- Consult eval trial metadata now lives in `eval/trials/*/trial.yaml`; generic
  Trial, Regression, and Bench runner code is provided by Pi Do Eval instead
  of project-local TypeScript.

### Fixed

- `consult` now exposes its dependency skills and runtime extensions
  through its Pi manifest, so `pi install npm:consult` activates the
  skills, Interface Design Gate, proof-first runtime, and whiteboarding guard in
  one install.
- `./setup.sh` now prunes legacy Consult-owned `~/.codex/skills/` links when the
  Consult Codex plugin is installed and warns that Codex can still duplicate Consult
  via direct `~/.agents/skills/` discovery if both install paths stay enabled.

## [2.2.0] (2026-04-26)

### Added

- `workflow` master entrypoint skill: load on every software
  engineering task, identify the risk profile, and select the narrower
  Consult skills that apply.
- Acceptance-clarity and branch-hygiene gates in the `workflow` skill
  flow, with matching tripwires.
- Requirements and acceptance criteria coverage in the `documentation`
  skill, plus a new `references/requirements-and-acceptance.md`.
- Codex plugin packaging under `plugin/.codex-plugin/`.
- API evolution reference in the `api` skill.
- `data-first` and `architecture` skills (extracted from the prior
  `domain-design` skill).
- `ui-design` skill (replacing the prior `frontend` skill).
- Skill anatomy validator at `scripts/validate_skill_anatomy.py` and
  pre-commit hook at `.githooks/pre-commit`.
- `LICENSE` (MIT), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and this
  `CHANGELOG.md`.
- `license` and `keywords` fields in the Claude plugin manifests so
  marketplace listings have complete metadata.
- Release script at `scripts/release.sh` to bump every manifest
  version, promote `[Unreleased]` in the changelog, run validators,
  commit, and tag in one pass.

### Changed

- README repositioned: Consult is presented as ambient; agents use
  `workflow` automatically rather than via a `/`-style command.
- Documentation skill description and triggers expanded to cover
  PRDs, specs, user stories, and acceptance criteria.

### Removed

- `domain-design` skill (split into `data-first` and `architecture`).
- `frontend` skill (replaced by `ui-design`).
- `scripts/sync_agents_md.py` and its tests (replaced by the anatomy
  validator workflow).
