# Commit

## Iron Law

`COMMIT ONLY THE REVIEWED SLICE. STAGE FILES BY NAME.`

Commit packaging is common and should stay lightweight. Load `git-workflow`
only when branches, conflicts, rebases, history edits, recovery, or GitHub CLI
use are part of the task.

## When to Use

- The user asks to commit, stage, split, or package current changes.
- You need to group dirty files into one or more logical commits.
- You need a right-sized commit subject or body for approved work.

## When NOT to Use

- Creating or switching branches, resolving conflicts, rebasing, bisecting,
  recovering history, deleting branches, or force-pushing. Use `git-workflow`.
- Reviewing correctness of the diff. Use `code-review` before packaging
  non-trivial implementation work.
- Preparing release versions, changelogs, tags, or publishing. Use `release`
  only when requested or approved.

## Workflow

1. Inspect one compact preflight: `git status --short`, current branch, staged
   diff stat, unstaged diff stat, and recent log. Stop on unexpected state.
2. Separate unrelated work. Stage only named files or approved pathspecs for
   the reviewed slice; never use `git add .` in a messy tree.
3. Verify staged membership with `git diff --cached --stat` and, when risk
   appears, inspect the staged diff before committing.
4. Confirm relevant proof is current. If a broad suite is noisy for unrelated
   reasons, name the targeted proof and report the broader drift separately.
5. Write a commit message that completes "When applied, this commit will ...".
   Use a concise subject. Add a body only when the change needs context, up to
   2-3 short paragraphs.
6. Commit without skipping hooks. Afterward, check status and recent log.

## Verification

- [ ] Only reviewed files are staged; unrelated dirty or untracked files are
      left unstaged and named as deferred.
- [ ] The staged diff matches one logical change.
- [ ] The relevant proof or acceptance check is current, or the blocker is
      reported as unproven.
- [ ] The subject completes "When applied, this commit will ...".
- [ ] The message is right-sized: concise subject, optional body, no generated
      attribution trailers.
- [ ] Hooks were not skipped, and post-commit status/log were inspected.

## Tripwires

| Trigger | Do this instead | False alarm |
|---|---|---|
| "Commit everything dirty" | Separate current reviewed work from unrelated files first. | The user explicitly approved the full dirty tree. |
| "git add . is faster" | Stage named files or approved pathspecs only. | Fresh scaffold with a clean tree where every file belongs. |
| "This needs a long message" | Use a concise subject plus at most 2-3 short body paragraphs. | Release or migration commits with approved notes. |
| "Skip hooks to save time" | Run the hook or fix/report its blocker. | None. |

## Handoffs

- Use `git-workflow` for branch hygiene, conflicts, rebases, bisects, history
  recovery, branch deletion, force-push decisions, or GitHub CLI use.
- Use `code-review` before committing non-trivial implementation changes.
- Use `proof` when the evidence for the staged behavior is unclear.
- Use `release` for approved version, changelog, tag, publish, rollout, or
  rollback work.
