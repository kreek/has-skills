# UI Design

## Iron Law

`START FROM THE USER TASK AND HIERARCHY; EVERY ELEMENT EARNS ITS PLACE.`

## When to Use

- Building or materially changing UI layout, components, design systems,
  typography, color, motion, responsive behavior, or frontend structure that
  affects user interaction.

## When NOT to Use

- Backend API shape; use `api`.
- Accessibility-specific implementation or review; use `accessibility`.
- Frontend runtime debugging or tests only; pair with `proof` and browser
  tooling.
- Performance profiling beyond UI design choices; use `performance`.

## Core Ideas

1. One screen has one primary action and a clear information order.
2. Use a small token system for spacing, type, color, radius, and motion.
   Apply tokens consistently; avoid stray one-off values.
3. Accessibility is a design input, not a later review pass. Design keyboard,
   focus, contrast, reduced motion, touch targets, and screen-reader flow up
   front.
4. Component APIs express intent and state, not implementation convenience.
5. Modern CSS should reduce JavaScript and layout hacks when browser support
   allows it.

## Workflow

1. Identify the user, task, device constraints, and primary action. Choose
   existing framework/design-system patterns before inventing new ones.
2. Define hierarchy, layout, states, empty/error/loading behavior, and
   responsive rules.
3. Apply tokens consistently. Remove elements that do not improve
   comprehension, trust, or action.
4. Verify with real rendering, keyboard navigation, contrast, and
   reduced-motion behavior.

## Verification

- [ ] Hierarchy survives a squint/blur test, and one primary action is
      visually dominant per screen.
- [ ] Token system covers spacing, type, color, radius, motion; no stray
      one-off values in committed CSS.
- [ ] Accessibility inputs were considered at design time, not patched after:
      keyboard reach, focus order, contrast, reduced motion, touch target,
      screen-reader flow.
- [ ] UI states exist for loading, empty, error, disabled, and success where
      applicable.

## Tripwires

| Trigger | Do this instead | False alarm |
|---|---|---|
| "Add a card/section so it looks richer" | Start from the user task and hierarchy. Remove elements that do not improve comprehension, trust, or action. | The card groups repeated peer items or frames a real tool surface. |
| "We'll add loading/error/empty states later" | Define the required states with the layout. | The component cannot load, fail, or be empty. |
| "One-off spacing fixes this screen" | Use or extend the token system intentionally. | A browser or platform quirk needs a documented local fix. |
| "Custom control first, semantics later" | Start with native controls and route accessibility-specific behavior to `accessibility`. | The existing design system control already proves semantics and keyboard behavior. |
| "Pick the frontend framework before the interaction model" | Define the UI task, state, and flow first; use existing repo patterns where possible. | The user explicitly asked to compare frameworks. |

## Handoffs

- Use `proof` for UI behavior tests and browser-verified flows.
- Use `accessibility` for WCAG, ARIA, semantic HTML, keyboard, focus, contrast,
  screen-reader, and inclusive-design work.
- Use `performance` for measured Core Web Vitals or rendering regressions.
- Use `documentation` for design-system usage docs and ADRs.
